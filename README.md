# VaktinAndroid

Final group project for year 3 of Computer Science. I worked mostly on layout and styles of the app as well as a few parts of the functionality.

Vaktin is a staff scheduling app designed for the A&E department in Iceland's national hospital.



To run Vaktin:

  Open VaktinVefapp in Intellij
  
  We use Postman to make a GET request to localhost:8080/makedata
  
  Now mockdata should me accessible
  
  Open up Vaktin in AndroidStudio
